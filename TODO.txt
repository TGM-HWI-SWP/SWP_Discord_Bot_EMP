TODO:

#urgent
notification if dc bot gets message

# high priority
view should have buttons for reseting fun facts and dish tables simply delete the table and then call import_tables from db_loader and also add entry buttons dont work yet

^
tried to do this for dishes but now the db is soemhow broken probably because of import_tables not working as intended but i dont know why


implement update_log_messages function in discord_logic but no idea what it should do ask mateja

# optional
maybe a dark and light mode toggle in view.py

# at the end
make sure matejas new view.py also has matching docstrings and comments as the rest of the code and update ports.py to acomadate any new changes from view.py
and rewrite the controller and its ports.py and obv also and comemnts and docstrings in there
make sure tha variable names are consistent with the other files like e is in every other file called error instead so it should also be changed in view.py

# at the end 
remove discord token from config.ini and replace it with a placeholder token that is not valid and will not work and run it so the .env file gets updated

# at the end
readme and license need to be updated including a comprehensive guide to set up the bot (copy from other repo hihi)
