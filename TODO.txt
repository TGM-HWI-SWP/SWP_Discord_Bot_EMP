TODO (YES THIS IS IN ORDER OF PRIORITY SO FOLLOW IT):

# urgent
statistics message count in db doesnt work yet and also unique users and servers isnt counting yet (maybe needs to recount on startup to not miss any already connected servers and users)

# high priority
view.py needs to be refactored entirely and simplified

# high priority
orange theme in view.py needs to go (should be blue like discord) 

# optional
maybe a dark and light mode toggle in view.py

# at the end
have ai redo the ports.py so any new ports are added to the file and any old ports are removed

# at the end
entire code needs to be checked for readability and understandability (comments where necessary, constant variable names across files, docstrings in google style for every function and class, typehinting everywhere, and one-line docstrings or comments in the first line of every file describing its purpose)
definatly also add comments in the config.ini file to describe what each section and each variable is for

# at the end
let ai check the code for any problems (only errror nothing else) and make the code PEP 8 compliant

# at the end 
remove discord token from config.ini and replace it with a placeholder token that is not valid and will not work and run it so the .env file gets updated

# at the end
readme and license need to be updated
