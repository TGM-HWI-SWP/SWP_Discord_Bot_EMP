on custom messgages add dropdown to channel id so select from saved channels (e.g. channel_name (channel_id))

# optional

# at the end
make sure matejas new view.py also has matching docstrings and comments as the rest of the code and update ports.py to acomadate any new changes from view.py
and rewrite the controller and its ports.py and obv also and comemnts and docstrings in there
make sure tha variable names are consistent with the other files like e is in every other file called error instead so it should also be changed in view.py

# at the end 
remove discord token from config.ini and replace it with a placeholder token that is not valid and will not work and run it so the .env file gets updated

# at the end
readme and license need to be updated including links to the discord bot creation docs and to the rest of the simple installation insctructions as a first tab
